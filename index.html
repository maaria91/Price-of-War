        <h1>The Price of War</h1>
        <p>This interactive visualizations was a project done by Maaria Assami as 
            <br /> part of the Design Studio 2 class in the Information Design and  
            <br /> Visualization MFA program during the Spring 2016 semester under the 
            <br /> instruction of Perdo Cruz. It captures the grim history surrounding the   
            <br /> different interstate wars that happened between 1823 and 2003, and   
            <br /> the price that was payed by the bloodshed that accompanied those wars.
            <br />
            <br /> After selecting the desired timeframe from the timeline, you will see the
            <br />number of wars that were fought during that period. The bloodier the 
            <br /> time period, the more the drop fills up.
